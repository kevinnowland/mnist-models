   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to mnist-models's documentation!
========================================

   :caption: Contents:

This is a dummy repository meant to demonstrate some
coding best practices including how to document code and
then generate documentation from it. The repository can be
cloned and then installed via pip, but it merely wraps some
basic ML models that have been pre-trained on MNIST, and they
are certainly far from cutting edge or useful.
The repo does demonstrate how to use GitHub Actions for
CI, so that's nice, I suppose.
