This is a sample  pull request template which I have stored in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
It consists of fields which should be filled out by the developer opening a PR. It is 
[markdown](markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) 
file that GitHub knows to use when a PR is open. Note that GitHub understands
the check boxes that have been included here. The template is not used in the
PR that adds the template, but is used in subsequen PRs.
