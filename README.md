# MNIST Models

This repository exists to demonstrate the following features:

1. Structuring  a repository that is pip installable
2. Writing docstrings type hints to generate documentation using SOMETHING
4. Unit testing using pytest
3. Developing using pythons CI/CD tool Actions

The purpose of this repo is to simplify some interactions with MNIST,
train models on MNIST, and make available some pretrained models.

## Branch protections

If you are browsing this repo on github, note that the first thing I did
after writing the initial portion of this readme was to click on settings, 
then branches, and then add some branch protections. There might be more when
you are reading this, but I added pull request reviews before merging and
requiring conversation resolution before merging. These are simple protections
to ensure a small bit of code quality.

## Misc

Miscellaneous things to keep in mind

- commit messages should start with a command, e.g., "edit this file" or "fix bad formatting".
